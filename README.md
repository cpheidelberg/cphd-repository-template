## GitHub Repository Naming
To name your repositories, please use the following naming convention:

`[Prefix]-[Project Name]-[Tech Stack]`

- **Prefix**: Use prefixes to categorize repositories, e.g.,
  - `proj-` for project repositories
  - `lib-` for libraries
  - `doc-` for documentation
  - `app-` for applications
  - `data-` for data-related repositories

- **Project Name**: Provide a concise description of the project or repository's main purpose. This should be the most prominent part of the name.

- **Tech Stack**: Specify the technology, framework, tool, etc., on which the project is based.

- **Use CamelCase for Multi-Word Names**: If necessary, use camelCase for multi-word names, e.g., "computationalPathology."

- **No Underscores or Mixed Case**: Stick to hyphens and lowercase letters for simplicity and consistency.

- **No Special Characters**: Avoid special characters, spaces, or symbols in repository names.

For example, if you have a machine learning project related to image processing using Pytorch and OpenCV you can use:

- `proj-image-processing-pytorch-opencv`
- `proj-imageProcessing-pytorch-opencv`
